        <p><b id="firstWord"><em>Life’s</em></b> challenges aren’t here to defeat us — they’re here to shape us into the best version of ourselves. In moments of emotional turmoil, when it feels impossible to bear the weight of our feelings, lies the greatest opportunity for growth. Each hardship we face teaches us something new, helping us handle the next challenge with greater strength and clarity.</p>
        <p>No matter your personal story, we all need one thing during these times: to be truly seen, understood and free of judgment. My therapeutic practice is built on this foundation — a nonjudgmental, relational approach that offers understanding, connection, and unwavering presence. Together, we create a space for healing and growth, where you feel seen, heard, and supported on your journey.</p>

            <h1>My Experience</h1>
            <img src="C:\Users\kamil\OneDrive\Desktop\The Patch\Photos\Iwona.jpg" alt="Portrait of Iwona Zdziebko, Psychologist and Therapist" />
            <div class="experience-text">
            <p>My first training was in physical health and that was when I discovered the power of healing. I witnessed people thriving not because they were given medications or went under procedures. 
                They healed because they were offered emotional support and understanding of what they were going through. This moment of realization made me to choose a career in a psychology in psychotherapy.</p>
            <p>Over the course of nearly 30 years, I worked in inpatient settings, NHS urgent, community and specialist services, voluntary sectors, Local Authorities, schools and as a freelance. I offered an individual
                therapy to children and adults, a group and couple therapy.</p>    
            <p>My clinical work has brought me into contact with a broad spectrum of mental health presentations, including but not limited to personality disorders, mood disorders, psychosis, eating disorders, suicidality,
                self — harm, dual diagnoses, neurodiversity, learning difficulties and  complex post — traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD).</p>   
            <p>Over the years, I have cultivated expertise in several therapeutic modalities, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT),
                eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), art and dramatherapy, attachment-based therapy, and existential approaches. My interventions are client — centred and often integrate verbal and nonverbal 
                communication strategies to address the unique needs of each service user.</p>    
            <p>My eclectic approach emphasises fostering safety, skills development, and mentalization as key components of brief psychological interventions. Creative therapy, underpinned by a DBT framework, has been instrumental
                in teaching distress tolerance and emotional regulation skills, particularly for individuals with personality disorders and developmental trauma.</p>

    <div class="content-box">
        <p>In the realm of psychotherapy, words alone don’t always capture the depth of human emotions and experiences. Sometimes, healing requires a different language — one that transcends verbal expression. That’s where arts-based, drama, and body — centred therapies come in. These creative and somatic approaches offer powerful ways to access, process, and heal psychological wounds, helping clients reconnect with themselves in profound ways.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>Why Go Beyond Talk Therapy?</h2>
        <p>Traditional talk therapy is effective, but for many, it’s not the full picture. Trauma, stress, and emotional pain are often stored not just in the mind but also in the body. Some emotions or experiences may also be difficult to articulate through words alone. Arts — based, drama, and somatic (body — focused) therapies engage multiple senses and creative channels, allowing for a deeper and more holistic healing process.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Encourages</b> self — expression – Art provides a nonverbal way to express deep emotions.</li>
            <li><b>Reduces</b> anxiety and stress – The creative process itself can be calming and meditative.</li>
            <li><b>Accesses subconscious thoughts</b> – Artistic expression can reveal feelings that may be hard to articulate.</li>
            <li><b>Enhances self — awareness</b> – Visual representation of emotions can lead to greater insight.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>The Power of Dramatherapy</h2>
        <p>Drama therapy incorporates role — playing, storytelling, and movement to help clients explore emotions and experiences in a safe and supportive environment.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Explores different perspectives</b> – Clients can step into different roles, gaining new insights.</li>
            <li><b>Releases suppressed emotions</b> – Acting out experiences can help process trauma or unresolved conflicts.</li>
            <li><b>Builds confidence and resilience</b> – Dramatic expression fosters self — discovery and empowerment.</li>
            <li><b>Strengthens social skills</b> – Improves communication, empathy, and relationship dynamics.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>The Role of the Body in Psychotherapy</h2>
        <p>Our bodies store emotions, and movement — based therapies help release feelings that might not emerge through talk alone. Somatic therapy, dance therapy, and breathwork support clients in reconnecting with their bodies and regulating their nervous systems.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Releases stored trauma</b> – Movement can process trauma “frozen” in the body.</li>
            <li><b>Regulates the nervous system</b> – Practices like deep breathing and mindful movement promote relaxation.</li>
            <li><b>Restores mind — body connection</b> – Clients learn to trust and listen to their bodies.</li>
            <li><b>Builds emotional resilience</b> – Physical expression helps process and integrate emotions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>Who Can Benefit from Creative and Body — Based Therapies?</h2>
        <p>These approaches are especially beneficial for individuals experiencing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trauma and PTSD</li>
            <li>Anxiety and depression</li>
            <li>Stress and burnout</li>
            <li>Grief and loss</li>
            <li>Low self — esteem</li>
            <li>Relationship challenges</li>
            <li>Emotional blocks</li>
        </ul>
    </div>  

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>A Holistic Approach to Healing</h2>
        <p>Incorporating arts, drama, and the body into psychotherapy makes healing a richer, more embodied experience. These methods encourage deeper self — discovery, emotional release, and personal transformation, making therapy a dynamic and empowering journey.</p>
        <p>If you're seeking an approach that goes beyond words and engages your whole self, I invite you to explore these powerful modalities. Together, we can unlock new pathways to healing, growth, and self — expression.</p>

        <h1>Talking Therapies</h1>
        <p>A Holistic Approach to Healing: EMDR, ACT, DBT, Attachment — Based, and Existential Therapy.</p>
        <p>At my practice, I integrate evidence — based and experiential therapeutic approaches to support individuals in navigating their emotional challenges, healing past wounds, and building meaningful lives. Every person’s
            journey is unique, and therapy should reflect that. That’s why I offer a blend of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), attachment — based therapy, and existential therapy — each tailored to your specific needs.</p>
    </div>       

    <div class="EMD-section">
        <h2><b>EMDR: </b> Processing Trauma and Unblocking Healing</h2>
        <p>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a highly effective therapy for individuals dealing with trauma, PTSD, anxiety, and distressing memories. This structured approach helps the brain reprocess painful experiences, reducing their emotional intensity.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Releases</b> distress from past experiences without requiring extensive verbal recounting.</li>
            <li><b>Reduces</b> PTSD symptoms and emotional reactivity linked to traumatic memories.</li>
            <li><b>Helps break</b> patterns of fear, avoidance, and self — limiting beliefs.</li>
            <li><b>Strengthens</b> resilience and allows for a healthier emotional response to triggers.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ACT-section">
        <h2><b>ACT: </b>Living with Purpose and Psychological Flexibility</h2>
        <p>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a mindfulness — based approach that helps individuals accept their thoughts and emotions rather than struggling against them. It focuses on taking meaningful action in alignment with personal values.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Encourages</b> acceptance of difficult emotions rather than avoidance.</li>
            <li><b>Promotes</b> psychological flexibility, reducing the impact of negative thoughts.</li>
            <li><b>Helps</b> build a meaningful life by identifying and acting on core values.</li>
            <li><b>Supports</b> individuals with anxiety, depression, chronic pain, and trauma.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="DBT-section">
        <h2><b>DBT: </b>Emotional Regulation and Interpersonal Growth</h2>
        <p>Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) is particularly beneficial for individuals struggling with emotional dysregulation, intense relationships, or self — destructive behaviours. Originally developed for borderline personality disorder, it is now widely used for a range of emotional challenges.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Teaches</b> emotion regulation strategies to manage overwhelming feelings.</li>
            <li><b>Enhances</b> distress tolerance, reducing impulsive reactions.</li>
            <li><b>Improves</b> interpersonal effectiveness, fostering healthier relationships.</li>
            <li><b>Encourages</b> mindfulness, helping individuals stay present and grounded.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="ABT-section">
        <h2><b>Attachment — Based Therapy: </b>Healing Relationship Patterns</h2>
        <p>Our early relationships shape how we connect with others throughout life. Attachment — based therapy focuses on understanding these patterns and creating secure, healthy connections.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Identifies and heals</b> relational wounds from childhood or past experiences.</li>
            <li><b>Improves self-esteem and self — worth</b> by addressing unmet emotional needs.</li>
            <li><b>Enhances relationships</b> by fostering secure attachment and communication skills.</li>
            <li><b>Supports individuals</b> with anxiety, depression, trauma, and relational difficulties.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="per-section">
        <h2>A Personalized Approach to Your Healing</h2>
        <p>No single therapy works for everyone, which is why I integrate these approaches to create a personalize treatment plan that fits your needs. Whether you’re working through past trauma, struggling with emotional regulation, seeking deeper meaning, or looking to improve relationships, therapy can be a transformative space for growth.</p>

    <h1>Relational Leadership: Transforming Workplace Culture & Performance</h1>

    <p>Empowering Leaders Through Connection & Collaboration</p>

    <p>Leadership is not just about strategy and decision-making — It’s about relationships. In today’s fast-paced and complex work environments, effective leadership requires more than authority; it demands emotional intelligence, trust — building, and the ability to foster meaningful connections.</p>

    <p>With many years of leadership experience in the NHS, voluntary, and local authority sectors, I offer Relational Leadership Coaching & Consultancy to help leaders and organizations cultivate authentic, people — centred leadership that drives both performance and workplace well — being.</p>

    <h2>What is Relational Leadership?</h2>

    <p>Relational Leadership is an approach that emphasises human connection, psychological safety, and shared purpose within teams and organizations. It focuses on:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Building Trust & Psychological Safety — Creating environments where employees feel heard, valued, and empowered to contribute.</li>
        <li>Effective Communication & Conflict Resolution — Helping leaders navigate difficult conversations and foster open, honest dialogue.</li>
        <li>Emotional Intelligence in Leadership — Understanding and managing emotions to inspire, engage, and motivate teams.</li>
        <li>Authenticity & Ethical Leadership — Leading with integrity, self-awareness, and alignment with core values.</li>
        <li>Inclusive & Collaborative Decision-Making — Encouraging participation and co-creation rather than top-down directives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who Can Benefit?</h2>

    <p>This approach is particularly valuable for:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Senior Leaders & Executives — Those looking to refine their leadership style and enhance team dynamics.</li>
        <li>New & Emerging Leaders — Professionals transitioning into leadership roles who want to develop strong relational skills.</li>
        <li>HR & Organizational Development Teams — Supporting culture change, leadership development, and employee engagement.</li>
        <li>Healthcare, Local Government & Voluntary Sector Organizations — Sectors where relational, values-driven leadership is essential for impact and sustainability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Approach</h2>

    <p>Drawing from my leadership experience in healthcare (NHS), voluntary organization, and local government, I bring a deep understanding of the challenges leaders face in complex, high — pressure environments. My approach is:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Reflective & Insightful</b> — Helping leaders gain self-awareness about their leadership style and its impact.</li>
        <li><b>Action-Oriented</b> — Combining deep reflection with practical tools and strategies for real — world application.</li>
        <li><b>Contextually Grounded</b> — Understanding sector-specific challenges and tailoring leadership development accordingly.</li>
        <li><b>Strength-Based & Growth-Focused</b> — Identifying and building on existing leadership strengths while addressing blind spots.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Services Offered</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>1:1 Leadership Coaching</b> — Personalize coaching to enhance relational leadership skills.</li>
        <li><b>Team Development Workshops</b> — Facilitating sessions on trust, collaboration, and effective communication.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Why Relational Leadership?</h2>

    <p>In a world where employee engagement, retention, and workplace culture are more critical than ever, relational leadership is not a “nice — to — have” it’s a necessity. Leaders who prioritize relationships, trust, and emotional intelligence foster more engaged teams, higher morale, and better organizational outcomes.</p>

    <h2>Let’s Work Together</h2>

    <p>If you’re looking to develop relational leadership within your organization, I’d love to explore how we can collaborate.</p>
